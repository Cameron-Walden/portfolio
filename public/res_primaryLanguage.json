      "description": "I have a background in  audio engineering, customer relations and as a performing artist. This is all to say that I have a wide range of skills and services at my disposal and am able to accomplish anything I set out to do. I have constantly and consistently proven myself to go above and beyond while working on projects either as an individual or as part of a team. I feel extremely confident in taking on leadership roles, but also have no issues with following orders. I love problem solving and thrive in high stakes environments. I'm always searching for the next big challenge and ways to improve myself. I'm looking for opportunities where I can both learn new skills and solidify the ones I already have. I feel the best way to learn is through teaching, so I'm also looking for opportunities to help others reach their full potential, because in turn, they would be helping me reach mine.",
